# InkyAdventure2018

This is a test project I've created to try making a simple game in Unity with Ink. More details when I actually know what I'm doing.

# Setting up

* Install Unity
* Install the Ink integration from the Unity Asset Store https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/ink-unity-integration-60055
* Clone this project and direct Unity to open the folder you cloned it into (Unity projects are folders, not individual files)

# Acknowledgements

* Ink is the open source narrative scripting language developed by Inkle. https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/
